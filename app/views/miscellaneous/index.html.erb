  <strong>1: Netflix, Do Better</strong>
</p>
<p class="misc-p">
  This was a meme about the page the used to exist on the Netflix site that
  just contained an h1 with "Hello World!!". Due to global includes, the page
  used ~400kb of javascript to do this. This is my version without any JS and
  using noncompliant HTML, which is about 23 bytes.
